> `reattempt` is a modern JavaScript library for the browser and Node.js that lets you retry asynchronous functions when they fail because some functions deserve a second chance, or a third or maybe even several dozen or so.

## Getting Started

To get started, add `reattempt` to your project:

```
npm i --save-dev reattempt
```

## Usage

### Asynchronous Promise-Based Functions

When an `async` function (or a function that returns a `Promise`) is passed to `Reattempt.run`, the function will be called immediately. If the functions reject with an error, `Reattempt.run` will retry calling that function. The function will be retried until it resolves, or until the maximum retries count is reached, whichever comes first.

```js
import Reattempt from 'reattempt';

async function doSomethingAsync() {
  // doing async operation that may throw
  return result;
};

async function main() {
  try {
    const result = await Reattempt.run({ times: 3 }, doSomethingAsync);
  } catch (error) {
    // an error is thrown if the function rejects with an error after
    // exhausting all attempts
  }
}
```

### Node.js Error-First Callbacks

Reattempt also works with functions following the _error-first callbacks_ pattern. When working with these functions, instead of passing an `async` or `Promise` based function, pass a function with a single argument called `done`. Use this argument as the error-first callback of your function.

The function will be retried until it returns a value without an error, or until the maximum retries count is reached, whichever comes first.

```js
import fs from 'fs';
import Reattempt from 'reattempt';

async function main() {
  try {
    const data = await Reattempt.run({ times: 3 }, done => {
      fs.readFile('./path/to/file', 'utf8', done);
    });
  } catch (error) {
    // an error is thrown if the function rejects with an error after
    // exhausting all attempts
  }
}
```


### Working with TypeScript

#### Reattempt As A Decorator

Reattempt also comes as a decorator that can be imported from `reattempt/decorator`.

```ts
import Reattempt from 'reattempt/decorator';

class Group {
  @Reattempt({ times: 3, delay: 5000 })
  private async getUserIds() {
    const user = await fakeAPI.getUsers(this.id); // could throw!
    return users.map(user => user.id);
  }

  public async doSomething() {
    try {
      const result = await this.getUserIds();
    } catch (error) {
      // Only throws after failing 3 attempts with 5 seconds in between
    }
  }
}
```

#### Type Safe Callbacks

Reattempt can infer types of async and Promise-based functions automatically. However, when working with error-first callbacks, you can enforce type safety by providing a type argument informing Reattempt about the type of value your function could potentially return.

```ts
Reattempt
  .run<Buffer>({ times: 3 }, done => {
    fs.readFile('./path/to/file', done);
  })
  .then(value => /* value is of type Buffer */)
  .catch(error => /* ... */);
```

## API

### Methods

#### `run(options: Options, callback: Callback): Promise`

Runs and reattempt the provided callback. If the callback fails, it will be reattempted until it resolves, or until the maximum retries count `options.times` is reached, whichever comes first.

Returns a `Promise` that resolves with the result of the provided function, and rejects with the same error it could reject with.


### Reattempt Options

All Reattempt methods accept an options object as the first argument with the following properties:

#### `times: number`

The number of times a function can be reattempted.

If this property is not provided Reattempt will perform the provided function once without any additional reattempts on failure.

#### `delay?: number`

The duration in milliseconds between each attempt. Defaults to `0`.

If this property is not provided Reattempt will perform a reattempt as soon as the function fails.

### Reattempt Callback

All Reattempt methods take a function as the second argument.

This function will be reattempted on failure and can be one of three forms:

- An `async` function.

```js
Reattempt.run({ times: 2 }, async () => {
  // ...
});
```

- A function that returns a `Promise`

```js
Reattempt.run({ times: 2 }, () => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    //...
  });
});
```

- A non-`async`, non-`Promise` function that wraps functions with error-first-callbacks

```js
Reattempt.run({ times: 2 }, done => {
  fs.readFile('path/to/file', 'utf-8', done);
});
```
